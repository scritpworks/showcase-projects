🧠 System Overview

The Water Utility System automates the entire water management workflow — from customer registration and meter reading to bill generation and payment tracking.
It provides an intuitive dashboard for both administrators and field staff, ensuring real-time visibility into consumption, arrears, and revenue trends.

The backend exposes a RESTful API, secured using JWT (stored in HttpOnly cookies) to prevent XSS attacks, while the frontend consumes these APIs via Axios for seamless data sync.
