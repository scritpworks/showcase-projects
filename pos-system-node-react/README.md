# 🟩 Multi-Branch POS System with GPS + Selfie Attendance Tracking

A comprehensive enterprise-level Point of Sale and workforce management system designed for organizations operating across multiple branches.  
It unifies **sales, inventory, and HR modules** — providing real-time insights into operations, staff performance, and financial activity.

## 🧠 Overview

This system enables administrators to manage products, branches, staff, and roles from a central dashboard.  
Each branch operates independently but syncs data to the main server.  
Attendance is captured through **selfie + GPS location**, and employees earn **salary points** automatically based on punctuality and the salary rules defined in the system.
